# Asteroid Watchers

## What it does / Overview

**Asteroid Watchers** is an educational web-based simulation platform that models near-Earth asteroid impacts and delivers comprehensive analysis of potentially hazardous objects. It integrates real NASA data, physics-based calculations, interactive 3D explorations, and an impact simulation engine for teaching and research support.

## How it works

### Data Collection & Processing

* Fetches real-time near-Earth object data from NASAâ€™s `NEO Web Service API`.
* Backend processing computes additional physical properties such as:

  * Mass estimation
  * Orbital energy
  * Impact velocities
    using gravitational physics calculations and standard astronomical constants.

### Interactive 3D Visualization

* 3D preview system with rotation and zoom to inspect asteroid shapes and characteristics visually.

### Impact Simulation Engine

Users can run physics-based impact simulations by:

1. Selecting specific dates to view available near-Earth objects.
2. Choosing an asteroid from a list (with approach distances).
3. Placing impact coordinates on an interactive map.
4. Running simulations that compute:

   * Crater size
   * Casualty estimates
   * Seismic effects
   * Fireball radius
   * Shock wave impacts

### Customization Tools

* Creator module to design custom asteroids (size, speed, composition) for "what-if" experiments.
